# portfolio
Hi, this is my portflio website. My name is Ayana Kulmakhanova, I am 18 years old. I am a media designer, web developer, photographer, and videographer. On this website you can see works created by me. I started the Interactive Media Design program in September 2021. I used to be interested in media design since I was 10 years old. I had a YouTube channel, that is why Photoshop, videography, photography and other things are pretty much familiar to me. I really like my program. While creating this web portfolio I faced some challenges, for example, I could not pick a font that would describe my personality well, or colours that would perfectly match. However, after completing this website I think it looks great. I also used JavaScript, I was not a pro in JS before creating this web portfolio, so I learned a few things from it. One more challenge was creating a logo, I had this logo before, but again, I was debating about the colours.
